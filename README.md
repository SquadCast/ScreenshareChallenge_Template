# üéô The #Screenshare Challenge Template üéô

Welcome to the Screenshare Challenge, our goal is to create a simple web application using Angular, Typescript, NodeJS, ExpressJS, and more. The general idea is to build application that allows users to share their screen, take a screenshot of what they're currently sharing, and allow them to upload that screenshot to Firebase.

# üí° Your Goals üí°

Craft a unique experience that makes it super easy to take a screenshot of your screen or desktop within a canvas on the web application. #ScreenshareChallenge. For this challenge, break down the Web Application into a FEAN (Firebase Express Angular Node) Application. Very similar to a MEAN app with CRUD (Create Read Upload Delete) capabilities.

## üñ•Ô∏è Front End üñ•Ô∏è

‚Ä¢ Visit a single web page application.  
‚Ä¢ Developed using Angular with Typescript  
‚Ä¢ Open-Source Components/Packages are welcomed and encouraged!  
‚Ä¢ _Optional: Use the prebuilt template as a starting point._  
‚Ä¢ Grant permission to the user‚Äôs desktop/screen.  
‚Ä¢ Ask the user if they would like to share their screen.  
‚Ä¢ View what they‚Äôre sharing in the web application.  
‚Ä¢ _Optional: The Prebuilt Template has a canvas as a placeholder to view what you‚Äôre sharing._  
‚Ä¢ Click a button to capture the canvas as a screenshot.  
‚Ä¢ _Optional: The Prebuild Template has a button as a placeholder in the UI._  
‚Ä¢ Open-Source Packages are welcomed!

## ‚öôÔ∏è Back End ‚öôÔ∏è

‚Ä¢ Upload the #ScreenshareChallenge Image to a backend point.  
‚Ä¢ After the user captures the canvas, upload that to a Firebase Real-Time Database. The Firebase can be your own private one. You can open a free Firebase account by going to their site.  
‚Ä¢ Build the routing and endpoints using NodeJS and ExpressJS.  
‚Ä¢ The Request Body should include the screenshot.  
‚Ä¢ The Response Body should include the URL of the #ScreenshareChallenge image.  
‚Ä¢ Allow the user to save the screenshot locally.  
‚Ä¢ Allow the user to view the URL after it‚Äôs uploaded.

## ‚ú® Bonus ‚ú®

_(These are bonuses if you have the time for them, these are optional)_  
‚Ä¢ Allow the user to preview the captured #ScreenshareChallenge image before uploading it to Firebase.  
‚Ä¢ Display the upload process as a progress bar or percentage somewhere on the web app.  
‚Ä¢ Secure the Firebase upload endpoint with a Token.  
‚Ä¢ Validate the token with ExpressJS.  
‚Ä¢ Deploy Both Apps to App Engine or Firebase Hosting.
